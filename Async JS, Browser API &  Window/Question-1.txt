The XMLHttpRequest object is a built-in JavaScript API that allows for making HTTP requests to web servers from within a web browser. It enables the retrieval of data from a server without needing to reload the entire web page. XMLHttpRequest is the foundation of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), a set of web development techniques used to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

Here's a brief overview of how XMLHttpRequest is used in AJAX:

1. Create an instance**: Developers create a new instance of the XMLHttpRequest object using the `new` keyword.

2. Open a connection**: They specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and the URL of the server-side resource they want to interact with using the `open()` method of the XMLHttpRequest object.

3. Set up event listeners**: Event listeners are set up to handle various states of the request, such as when the request completes successfully or encounters an error.

4. Send the request**: The request is sent to the server using the `send()` method. If it's a POST request, data to be sent to the server can be included as an argument to the `send()` method.

5. Receive the response**: When the server responds, the response data can be accessed using properties and methods of the XMLHttpRequest object, such as `responseText` or `responseXML`.

6. Handle the response**: Depending on the application's logic, developers process the response data and update the user interface dynamically without reloading the entire page.

Overall, XMLHttpRequest facilitates the asynchronous exchange of data between the client and server, enabling the creation of responsive and interactive web applications. However, newer alternatives like the Fetch API offer more modern and flexible ways to make HTTP requests, but XMLHttpRequest remains widely used and supported for legacy reasons.
