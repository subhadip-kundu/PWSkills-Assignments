The same-origin policy confines AJAX requests to the same domain for security reasons, preventing malicious websites from accessing data from other domains without permission. To overcome this restriction, several workarounds exist. JSONP (JSON with Padding) allows loading JSON data by dynamically inserting a script tag, bypassing the policy. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enables servers to specify which origins are allowed to access their resources, granting permission for cross-origin requests. Another approach involves setting up a server-side proxy, where requests are made to the same domain as the web page, and the server forwards them to the desired external domain. Additionally, loading content in an iframe from another domain is a less common method but can still circumvent the same-origin policy for certain use cases. Each approach has its own benefits and limitations, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
