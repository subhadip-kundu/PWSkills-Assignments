 Browser APIs are functionalities provided by web browsers to interact with various aspects of the web platform. Here are some common Browser APIs available to JavaScript developers:

1. DOM (Document Object Model) API: This API allows JavaScript to interact with the structure and content of HTML documents. Developers can manipulate elements, modify their attributes, and respond to user events.

2. Fetch API: The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources asynchronously across the network. It offers a more powerful and flexible way to make HTTP requests compared to the older XMLHttpRequest.

3. Web Storage API: This API provides mechanisms for storing key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, including sessionStorage and localStorage. Developers can store data persistently or session-based, depending on their needs.

4. IndexedDB API: IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. It allows for the storage and retrieval of objects that are indexed with a key.

5. Web Workers API: Web Workers enable running scripts in background threads, allowing for concurrent execution and improved performance. This API helps offload tasks from the main UI thread, preventing UI freezes.

6. Web Audio API: This API provides advanced audio processing and synthesis capabilities in the browser. Developers can create, manipulate, and synchronize audio streams for applications such as games or music players.
