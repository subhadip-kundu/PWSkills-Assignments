Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

--> HTML and JavaScript, the web's dynamic duo!

HTML: Architect of the web. Builds the blueprint with tags, laying out text, images, and links like bricks. Static, but sturdy.

JavaScript: The choreographer. Breathes life into HTML, making buttons dance, forms react, and content update in real-time. Dynamic, but needs the blueprint.

Think of a restaurant website. HTML builds the menu and displays pictures of dishes. JavaScript powers the ordering system, calculates bills, and shows live table availability.

Together, they create vibrant, interactive experiences that keep us glued to the web!
