
// Comments in JavaScript play a crucial role in enhancing code quality and collaboration among developers. They provide a means to explain the purpose, functionality, or complex logic within the code, improving overall readability. By adding comments, developers can document their code, making it easier for others (or even themselves in the future) to understand and work with the codebase.


// Example


// Single line comment
