In JavaScript, operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated, with higher precedence operators being evaluated first. Associativity, on the other hand, defines the order of evaluation when operators of the same precedence appear in an expression. Understanding these concepts is vital for writing reliable and predictable code. It helps developers avoid unintended consequences by ensuring that expressions are evaluated in the intended order. Without a clear understanding of operator precedence and associativity, code may produce unexpected results or errors, making it challenging to maintain and debug. Therefore, familiarity with these concepts is essential for writing clean, readable, and error-free JavaScript code.
